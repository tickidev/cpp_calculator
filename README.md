# Simple C++ Calculator

## Description

This is a simple calculator program written in C++ that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, users can clear the console screen and exit the program at any time.

The program uses a `do-while` loop to keep asking for input, a `switch-case` statement for operation selection, and an `if-else` block to handle edge cases like division by zero. It also includes a clear screen feature for a better user experience.
